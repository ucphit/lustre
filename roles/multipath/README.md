# dm\_multipath

This roles installs and configures Linux `dm_multipath` driver to access 

## Example Playbook

Install dm-multipath and configure with defaults and ensure it's started:

```
...
    - hosts: all
      roles:
         - dm_multipath
```


Gather information about SAS controllers and JBODs 
and let Ansible name the DM multipath devices depending on their jbods.
This prevents the autodiscovery+naming of multipath devices and
instead creates multipath devices named like: `/dev/mapper/primary-<WWID>`.

```
...
    - hosts: all
      vars:
        dm_multipath_sas_jbods:
          primary: "3500c0ff06711383c"
          secondary: "3500c0ff06711d93c"
        dm_multipath_daemon_readonly_bindings: true
        dm_multipath_defaults_find_multipaths: "no"
        dm_multipath_defaults_user_friendly_names: "no"
      roles:
         - dm_multipath
```
